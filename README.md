## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This my first time building a slider with JavaScript and the results are quite rewarding. The grid layout was also interesing especially because I had to align the buttons with the layout. It was quite simple but really cool.
